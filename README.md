Project Name - NFL Social

Description
  NFL Social is a platform designed as an extension of NFL+.

NFL Social will also use machine learning to curate a personalized, immersive experience, produced by the content stream/feed.

Functionality

- Jamal the Ball, located in the bottom left corner of the webpage, is a WORKING chatbot trained on recent NFL data that can answer user questions and prompts (ask him a question!)

- Dark Mode, located in the web application in the profile drop-down menu (click the profile picture in the top right corner)
